Backend News API Proxy

This Express.js application serves as a proxy for making GET requests to a news API. It helps avoid Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues when fetching data from the news API in client-side applications deployed to different domains.

Purpose

The purpose of this backend app is to act as an intermediary between your client-side application and a news API, allowing you to fetch news data without encountering CORS errors.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

Before running this backend app, ensure that you have the following installed:

Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)


How It Works

This backend app listens for GET requests on a specified route 
(e.g., /api/) and then forwards those requests to the configured news API endpoint. It retrieves the data from the news API and sends it back to the client-side application as a response. The client-side application can make requests to this backend instead of directly to the news API to avoid CORS issues.

API Routes

/api/
Method: GET

Description: Fetches news data from the configured news API endpoint.

Example Usage:

javascript

fetch('newssite')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    // Process and use the news data
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error fetching news data:', error);
  });

Deployment
When deploying your client-side application, configure it to make requests to the backend news API proxy (/api/news) rather than directly to the news API endpoint. This setup will help you avoid CORS errors and securely fetch news data.
