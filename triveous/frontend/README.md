# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

News App

A responsive and user-friendly news application that allows users to register, log in, personalize their news preferences, and stay up-to-date with the latest news articles. This project utilizes Firebase for authentication, integrates with an open-source news API, and provides features such as grid view, news detail view, favorite articles, state management, offline support, and an aesthetically pleasing UI/UX.

Features

User Registration and Login

Users can create accounts and log in securely using Firebase authentication.

News API Integration

The app fetches the latest news articles from an open-source news API (e.g., newsapi.org).
Grid View

Users can toggle between list view and grid view to browse news articles.

News Detail View

Tapping on a news article displays a detailed view with the title, description, image, and a link to the full article. For Flutter, an in-app webview is used to show the full article.

Favorite Articles

Users can mark articles as favorites, and these preferences are stored in Firebase for persistence.

State Management

The project employs state management tools to efficiently manage and update the app's state.

Offline Support

Caching mechanisms are implemented to allow users to access previously fetched news articles even when they are offline.
Design and UI/UX

Attention is given to app design, resulting in a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing interface.
Responsive and Smooth UX

The app is designed to be responsive across various devices and provides a smooth user experience.
Technologies Used
React (for web app)
Firebase (for authentication and data persistence)
Open-source News API (e.g., newsapi.org)
State management library (e.g., Redux, MobX)
UI/UX design tools (e.g., CSS frameworks, Material Design)


Acknowledgments

Special thanks to newsapi.org for providing the news data source.
We appreciate the open-source community for their valuable contributions to the libraries and tools used in this project.
