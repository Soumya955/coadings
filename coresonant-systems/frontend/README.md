# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Todo Application with API Integration
Build a Todo application using React js that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. The
application should have the following functionalities:
● Display a list of existing tasks, showing the task name and its status (completed or not).
Initialize this list with the todos fetched from an API.
● Use the following API endpoint to retrieve the todos:
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1/todos.
● Each todo object from the API response will have the following properties:
● id (number): The unique identifier for the todo.
● title (string): The title of the todo.
● completed (boolean): Indicates whether the todo has been completed or not.
● Use this initial data to populate the list of tasks in your application.
● Provide an input field to add new tasks. When a task is added, it should appear in the list.
Perform the following validations before adding a task:
● The task name should not be empty.
● Allow users to mark a task as completed by clicking on it. Completed tasks should be
visually distinguishable (ex: By any different color).
● Allow users to edit the task name by clicking on an edit button/icon next to each task. When
a task is edited, update the task name in the list.
● Provide a delete button/icon to allow users to remove a task from the list.
● Implement a filter or tab functionality to toggle between displaying all tasks and completed
tasks.
Please create the necessary components and implement the logic to achieve the above
functionalities. You can use any additional libraries or CSS frameworks if needed. Remember to
fetch the initial todos from the API endpoint mentioned above and use them to populate the list of
tasks in your application. Let me know if you have any further question
